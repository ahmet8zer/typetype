# typetype
A Command Line Typing Game by Ahmet Ozer

## Installation
To install typetype, use the following command:
 `pip install typetype`


## Usage
To start playing the game, simply run:
`typetype`

## Options
`-lighter` option will make the untyped characters lighter (windows default)

`-darker` option will make the untyped characters darker (mac default)

To use the custom '|' cursor that I made, run the game with the `-cursor` option.

## About
`typetype` is a minimalistic command line typing game. I made this game becuase I couldn't find any command line typing games that I liked, so I decided to make one myself. I made this game in 1 week and worked on it during my trip to canada. Since it is a minimalistic game, I did not include much text/instructions. In order to see the game's unwritten controls please read the Navigation section before playing the game.
